No, you **cannot upgrade directly** from an Intel i5 8th generation CPU to an i5 10th generation CPU on the same motherboard.

### Here's why:

* ✅ **Different Socket**:

  * **i5 8th gen** uses **LGA 1151 (v2)** socket.
  * **i5 10th gen** uses **LGA 1200** socket.
* ✅ **Different Chipset**:

  * 8th gen CPUs run on **Intel 300 series chipsets (H310, B360, Z370, etc.)**.
  * 10th gen CPUs require **Intel 400 series chipsets (H410, B460, Z490, etc.)**.
* ✅ **Motherboard Compatibility**:

  * You would need a **new motherboard** to support the 10th gen CPU.

### ✅ Your Options:

* **Upgrade within 8th gen**: You can go for **i7 8700/8700K** or **i7 9700** (some motherboards support up to 9th gen after BIOS update).
* **Upgrade to 10th gen**: You need to **change motherboard + possibly RAM** (DDR4 remains the same for 10th gen, but double-check frequency support).

If you share your current **motherboard model**, I can guide you on the best CPU upgrade options without changing everything.
